The Random Maze Game is a application designed to prevent boredom by entertaining the user. The application does this by randomly generating a maze, that the user must quickly navigate through in order to get a score. The faster the user can find their way through the maze, the higher the score they shall recieve. The maze has diffent difficulty levels, designed for players of all ages. The difficulty level changes the size of the maze, so if the user finds the maze to easy or to difficult they can simply change the difficulty level to suit their needs.

Instructions For Use:

- To begin playing The Random Maze Game simply select a difficulty level by selecting either "1" for Easy, "2" for Medium, or "3" for Hard. Selecting a difficulty level will bring up the maze.
- Your player icon is "P" it displays the users position in the maze. Move the player icon by using the arrow or WASD keys to navigate through the maze. Your goal is to make your way through the maze as quickly as possible.
- Once you reach the end of the maze another menu screen will appear. This screen will tell how fast you made it through the maze and will also give you a score. However if the player does not reach the end of the maze before time limit runs out the player will recieve a score of 0. The time limit is 20 seconds on Easy, 30 seconds on Medium and 40 seconds on Hard.
- On this screen there will also be 3 options for you to choose. Pressing "1" will recreate the maze at the current difficulty level. Pressing "2" will bring you back to the first option menu where you can change your difficuly level. Pressing "3" will exit the game.
