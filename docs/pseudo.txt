Maze Generation Pseudo Code:
stack = empty array
Starting cell = random x, y
x, y = starting cell

method x,y
  mark current cell as visited
  choices = unvisited surrounding cells
  if no choices:
    if stack empty:
      MAZE DONE - exit recursion
    set x, y to previous cell (pop from stack)
    restart method
  randomly choose one cell from choices
  set x, y = chosen cell
  add chosen direction to current cell's available directions
  add opposite direction to new cell's available directions
  push current cell onto stack
  remove wall between current cell and chosen cell
  restart method

print maze
